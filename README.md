# Aura Runtime Environment
Is a semi-failed experiment due to continued complications in attempting to be both aligned and not. Also, it is the current (and only working) platform for Interlink Mail & News for the moment.

This repo is no longer getting primary development but will get applicable UXP security fixes and minor application fixes and enhancements until we switch over to the next phase in Interlink that should help foster it's continued existance regardless of other BinOC Projects.
